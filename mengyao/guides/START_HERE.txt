📚 LEARNING PATH
========================================

STEP 1: EXPLORE THE APP
-----------------------
• Add a product
• Edit a product
• Delete a product
• Navigate between pages
• Open browser DevTools (F12) to see how it works

STEP 2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE
---------------------------
Start with these files in order:
1. pages/login.php - login form 
2. pages/requestAccount.php - registration form where users requests for an account
3. pages/adminDashboard.php - user requests and existing users will be shown
                            - admin can assign the user request a role before approving/rejecting it
                            - when it is approved, the user request gets deleted from the user_requests table; when it is rejected, the user request gets deleted from the user_requests table
                            - admin can edit an existing user account by clicking on the edit button and gets directed to editusers.php
4. pages/editusers.php - edit form for existing user accounts
5. pages/process_request - processes what happens when admin click on approve/reject for user requests
6. pages/logout.php - redirects admin back to login page after clicking logout
7. css/style.css - Styling

All files have inline comments explaining the code!


STEP 4: READ THE GUIDES
-----------------------
• TECHNICAL_GUIDE.txt - Concepts and best practices
• PACKAGE_CONTENTS.txt - Complete package overview
• README.md - Project documentation

- It's okay to not understand everything immediately
- Confusion is part of the learning process
- Every expert was once a beginner
- Making mistakes is how you learn
- Practice is more important than theory

The actual code files contain detailed inline comments that explain the
implementation. This guide package focuses on concepts and organization.

Good luck on your coding journey! 🚀
